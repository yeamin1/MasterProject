	Iâ€™m writing in response to your recently advertised position for a Data Scientist. I am very interested in this opportunity with Robert Walters and believe that my educational background in Statistics and diverse skills would make me be a strong candidate for the position. \\~\\
	I am a recently graduated student (Master of Science Major in Statistics) from the University of Auckland. I have strong programming and modeling skills. I took a summer project that developed an R package called iNZightMaps, for which visualizing geographic data. \\~\\
	As a member of the developer, my job is to build the based level functions of the package. One example will be to draw a world map by using a GIS data. The maps will be drawn by using the information, which contains the coordinates of every country, extracted from a GIS data. \\~\\
	However, the hardest part is the efficiency. Since the size of a GIS data normally will be huge, it will take very long to draw the maps. Therefore, users may feel impetuous for waiting. The source codes need to be optimized as faster as possible. In these capacities, I earnt lots of coding experiences. \\~\\
	I firmly believe that I can be a valuable asset to your team. I welcome the opportunity to speak with you about this position and how my experience could help Robert Walters achieve its goals. \\~\\
	Thank you in advance for your consideration.
