DONE(maybe):

    + uploaded a persp() example
    
    + add lty, lwd, col.lab, cex.lab, col.axis testing on qq.Read
    
    + fixed the 'lim' problem by fixing the 'EdgeDone' on the 'PerspBox()' function.
    
    + fixed the 'expand' problem by using two viewport (clipping on for drawing the shape, 
                                                        off for drawing axis/label)
                                                
    + emulated the shade parameters
    
Not DONE
    +  Read Chapt 11 of "Computer Graphics" to understand how 3D transformation
    matrices work   
    
    
Wish to discuss:
    + Bug on the filling the shade (colors are similiar, but not identical) 
    + need vectoriztion for calculation the color for shading.
    + need to figure out what happen if we passing multiple colors when doing the shading
